Running Total Portfolio Item Grid

This is an example of how I made a column that did a running total in a rally grid. There might be other ways to do this, so feedback is welcome.

This assumes a custom field for the feature level of PIs is created called "Feature Point Estimate".  This is summed and put into a column for RunningTotal.  RunningTotal does not have to exist as a field.
